But I feel peaceful. Your success in the ring this morning was, to a small degree, my success. Your future is assured. You will live, secure and safe, Wilbur. Nothing can harm you now. These autumn days will shorten and grow cold. The leaves will shake loose from the trees and fall. Christmas will come, and the snows of winter. You will live to enjoy the beauty of the frozen world, for you mean a great deal to Zuckerman and he will not harm you, ever. Winter will pass, the days will lengthen, the ice will melt in the pasture pond. The song sparrow will return and sing, the frogs will awake, the warm wind will blow again. All these sights and sounds and smells will be yours to enjoy, Wilbur—this lovely world, these precious days…”

When labor is light and the morning is fair, I find it a pleasure beyond all compare To hitch up my nag1 and go hurrying down and take Katie May for a ride into town;  For bumpety-bump goes the wagon, But tra-la-la-la our lay. There's joy in a song as we rattle along In the light of the glorious day. A coach would be fine, but a spring wagon's good; My jeans are a match for Kate's gingham2 and hood; The hills take us up and the vales3 take us down, But what matters that? we are riding to town, And bumpety-bump goes the wagon,  But tra-la-la-la sing we. There's never a care may live in the air That is filled with the breath of our glee.

The bees are humming, humming in the clover; The bobolink1 is singing in the rye; The brook is purling2, purling in the valley, And the river's laughing, radiant, to the sky! The buttercups are nodding in the sunlight; The winds are whispering, whispering to the pine; The joy of June has found me; as an aureole3 it's crowned me Because, oh best beloved, you are mine!

And the trees all died. They were orange trees. I don’t know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn’t the best. We complained about it. So we’ve got thirty kids there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant and we’ve got these thirty dead trees. All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing.


I wish there were some wonderful place Called the Land of Beginning Again,Where all our mistakes and all our heartaches, And all our poor, selfish grieves1 Could be dropped, like a shabby2 old coat, at the door, And never put on again.We would find the things we intended to do,But forgot and remembered too late--Little praises unspoken, little promises broken, And all of the thousand and one Little duties neglected3 that might have perfected The days of one less fortunate. So I wish that there were some wonderful place Called the Land of Beginning Again,Where all our mistakes and all our heartaches, And all our poor, selfish grieves Could be dropped, like a ragged old coat, at the door, And never put on again.


I know you are too dear to stay; You are so exquisitely sweet: My lonely house will thrill someday To echoes of your eager feet. I hold your words within my heart, So few, so infinitely dear; Watching your fluttering hands I start At the corroding touch of fear. A faint, unearthly music rings From you to Heaven -- it is not far! A mist about your beauty clings Like a thin cloud before a star. My heart shall keep the child I knew, When you are really gone from me, And spend its life remembering you As shells remember the lost sea.

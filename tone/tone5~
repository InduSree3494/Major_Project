I am disturbed by how states abuse laws on Internet access  I am concerned that surveillance programmes are becoming too aggressive  I understand that national security and criminal activity may justify some exceptional and narrowly tailored use of surveillance  But that is all the more reason to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms 
Wolves and women are relational by nature  inquiring  possessed of great endurance and strength  They are deeply intuitive  intensely concerned with their young  their mate and their pack  Yet both have been hounded  harassed and falsely imputed to be devouring and devious  overly aggressive  of less value than those who are their detractors 

Oh Jerusalem  the city of sorrow
A big tear wandering in the eye
Who will halt the aggression 
On you  the pearl of religions 
Who will wash your bloody walls 
Who will safeguard the Bible 
Who will rescue the Quran 
Who will save Christ  
From those who have killed Christ 
Who will save man 
aggression
On you  the pearl of religions 
Who will wash your bloody walls 
Who will safeguard the Bible 
Who will rescue the Quran 
Who will save Christ  From those who have killed Christ 
Who will save man 
Oh Jerusalem my town
Oh Jerusalem my love
Tomorrow the lemon trees will blossom
And the olive trees will rejoice
Your eyes will dance
The migrant pigeons will return
To your sacred roofs
And your children will play again
And fathers and sons will meet
On your rosy hills
My town
The town of peace and olives

Mother Fuckers  They re going to feel pretty stupid when they find out 
They re fucking with the wrong people   
 
 We are only just beginning to understand the power of love because we are just beginning to understand the weakness of force and aggression   

 There are few genuine conservatives within the U S  political system  and it is a sign of the intellectual corruption of the age that the honorable term  conservatism  can be appropriated to disguise the advocacy of a powerful  lawless  aggressive and violent state  a welfare state for the rich dedicated to a lunatic form ofKeynesian economic intervention that enhances state and private power while mortgaging the country s future   

 When a man has a gift in speaking the truth  brute aggression is no longer his security blanket for approval  He  on the contrary  spends most of his energy trying to tone it down because his very nature is already offensive enough  

Why give a robot an order to obey orders why aren t the original orders enough  Why command a robot not to do harm wouldn t it be easier never to command it to do harm in the first place  Does the universe contain a mysterious force pulling entities toward malevolence  so that a positronic brain must be programmed to withstand it  Do intelligent beings inevitably develop an attitude problem      Now that computers really have become smarter and more powerful  the anxiety has waned  Today s ubiquitous  networked computers have an unprecedented ability to do mischief should they ever go to the bad  But the only mayhem comes from unpredictable chaos or from human malice in the form of viruses  We no longer worry about electronic serial killers or subversive silicon cabals because we are beginning to appreciate that malevolence like vision  motor coordination  and common sense does not come free with computation but has to be programmed in      Aggression  like every other part of human behavior we take for granted  is a challenging engineering problem!  

It would be well to realize that the talk of  humane methods of warfare   of the  rules of civilized warfare   and all such homage to the finer sentiments of the race are hypocritical and unreal  and only intended for the consumption of stay at homes  There are no humane methods of warfare  there is no such thing as civilized warfare  all warfare is inhuman  all warfare is barbaric  the first blast of the bugles of war ever sounds for the time being the funeral knell of human progress  What lover of humanity can view with anything but horror the prospect of this ruthless destruction of human life  Yet this is war  war for which all the jingoes are howling  war to which all the hopes of the world are being sacrificed  war to which a mad ruling class would plunge a mad world   
Women particularly should concern themselves with peace because men by nature are more foolhardy and headstrong  and their overwhelming desire to avenge themselves prevents them from foreseeing the resulting dangers and terrors of war  But woman by nature is more gentle and circumspect  Therefore  if she has sufficient will and wisdom she can provide the best possible means to pacify man   
There can be no socialism without a state  and as long as there is a state there is socialism  The state  then  is the very institution that puts socialism into action  and as socialism rests on aggressive violence directed against innocent victims  aggressive violence is the nature of any state   

Not all dogs are perfect dogs  but all dogs are inherently good  Like people  we are affected by environment and circumstance  Some breeds get a bad rap because sometimes humans breed them to be a certain way  like overly macho or protective  In our life on earth we are dependent on humans for everything  including our breeding  We can be bred for aggression or we can be bred for peace 

Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace  and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood  If this is to be achieved  man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge  aggression and retaliation  The foundation of such a method is love 

Aggression is a biological response to a life threatening situation  When there is an immediate threat to life  aggressive energy provides the power to do what needs to be done  Aggression in normal daily interactions is like activating a smoke alarm when there is no smoke  Actually  it is worse  The ringing alarm would be annoying  but it would do no harm  Aggression at best is annoying  and at worst  itself  becomes life threatening 

Aggression is part of the masculine design  we are hardwired for it     Little girls do not invent games where large numbers of people die  where bloodshed is a prerequisite for having fun  Hockey  for example  was not a feminine creation  Nor was boxing  A boy wants to attack something    and so does a man  even if it s only a little white ball on a tee 
The fact that bad is stronger than good is nowhere more apparent than in acts of violence and aggression  This principle is sometimes called the magnitude gap  referring to one important difference between the perpetrator and the victim  Almost inevitably  the victim loses more than the perpetrator gains  Aggression is thus not just a simple transfer or exchange  it lowers the total value available 

Aggression is different from anger  Anger is an emotion  aggression is a behavior  There are better ways to deal with anger than behaving aggressively  Aggressive talk  gestures or behaviors belong to the old way of being  Once we tune in to a higher level of consciousness  aggression is as unnecessary as is the hand held plow in modern day agriculture 

Our people went out every single night trying to stop crime before it happened  trying to take people off the street that they believed were involved in crime  That made us a very aggressive  proactive police department 

What makes anyone think that government officials are even trying to protect us  A government is not analogous to a hired security guard  Governments do not come into existence as social service organizations or as private firms seeking to please consumers in a competitive market  Instead  they are born in conquest and nourished by plunder  They are  in short  well armed gangs intent on organized crime  Yes  rulers have sometimes come to recognize the prudence of protecting the herd they are milking and even of improving its  infrastructure  until the day they decide to slaughter the young bulls  but the idea that government officials seek to promote my interests or yours is little more than propaganda unless  of course  you happen to belong to the class of privileged tax eaters who give significant support to the government and therefore receive in return a share of the loot   

If any man s money can be taken by a so called government  without his own personal consent  all his other rights are taken with it  for with his money the government can  and will  hire soldiers to stand over him  compel him to submit to its arbitrary will  and kill him if he resists

t s about the ways in which girls deal with anger and aggression  as opposed to the ways in which boys do  The premise is that boys tend to be more direct in their aggression   physical confrontation   while in contrast  girls use an indirect approach known as relational aggression  Relational aggression is a form of aggression where the group is used as a weapon to assault others and others  relationships  It uses lies  secrets  betrayals and a host of other two faced tactics to destroy or damage the relationships and social standing of others in the group   

As for children s working off aggressions  I m against it  They are going to need all the aggressions they can contain for ultimate release in the adult world  Name one great man in history who did not go boiling and bubbling through childhood with a lashed down safety valve 

Om is the presence which steals away  It steals away the ordinary mundane existence of strife  struggle and duality  it steals away anxiety  aggression  fear  grief and sorrow  it steals away the debris of anger  hatred  confusion and ignorance  to fill us with the nectar of joy  immortality and life eternal   



 Maybe you receive pain selfishly   thinking only of yourself  The cycle of pain wounds every participant  both victim and aggressor   


 A society that presumes a norm of violence and celebrates aggression  whether in the subway  on the football field  or in the conduct of its business  cannot help making celebrities of the people who would destroy it    
 Aggression like this demanded slinging the first punch in a bar brawl  firing rounds at a range  or setting a car on fire 

I will care a little less about some things   Learning to Care Less about the Disapproval of Others   Sophisticated people use passive aggressive means of coercion  That way they can get what they want without having to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing they bullied someone else into doing what they wanted  Extra points if you can be so subtle and skillful at justifying your actions that you even fool yourself  

Toxic people often hide cleverly behind passive aggression    Instead of openly expressing how they feel  someone makes subtle  annoying gestures directed at you  Instead of saying what s actually upsetting them  they find small and petty ways to take jabs at you until you pay attention and get upset  Obviously this is a toxic relationship situation

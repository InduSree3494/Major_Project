Technology is just a tool  In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them  the teacher is the most important 
The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do  It lets people be creative  It lets people be productive  It lets people learn things they didn t think they could learn before  and so in a sense it is all about potential 
Technology gives us power  but it does not and cannot tell us how to use that power  Thanks to technology  we can instantly communicate across the world  but it still doesn t help us know what to say 
Technology is supposed to make our lives easier  allowing us to do things more quickly and efficiently  But too often it seems to make things harder  leaving us with fifty button remote controls  digital cameras with hundreds of mysterious features and book length manuals  and cars with dashboard systems worthy of the space shuttle 

Cell phones  mobile e mail  and all the other cool and slick gadgets can cause massive losses in our creative output and overall productivity 
The new electronic independence re creates the world in the image of a global village 

Technology is such a broad kind of term  it really applies to so many things  from the electric light to running cars on oil  All of these different things can be called technology  I have kind of a love hate relationship with it  as I expect most people do  With the computer  I spend so many hours sitting in front of a computer 
The most important and urgent problems of the technology of today are no longer the satisfactions of the primary needs or of archetypal wishes  but the reparation of the evils and damages by the technology of yesterday 

Cyberspace  A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators  in every nation  by children being taught mathematical concepts 

The digital camera is a great invention because it allows us to reminisce  Instantly 

The Internet is the most important single development in the history of human communication since the invention of call waiting 
The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them 
Medical knowledge and technical savvy are biodegradable  The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack 
The most technologically efficient machine that man has ever invented is the book  Just because something doesn t do what you planned it to do doesn t mean it s useless It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity 
One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men  No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man 
Technology frightens me to death  It s designed by engineers to impress other engineers  And they always come with instruction booklets that are written by engineers for other engineers   which is why almost no technology ever works 
The greatest achievement of humanity is not its works of art  science  or technology  but the recognition of its own dysfunction 
First we thought the PC was a calculator  Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII   and we thought it was a typewriter  Then we discovered graphics  and we thought it was a television  With the World Wide Web  we ve realized it s a brochure 

Programs must be written for people to read  and only incidentally for machines to execute

Nowadays technology has brought a lot of changes to our life  especially in education and communication  In communication  the major changes happen in the way we communicate with other people  We do not need to meet them in person or face to face to say what is in our mind  We simply can phone them or do video chat using Internet connection  In the past  we spent a long time to travel to a distant place  but now we just need hours or even minutes to go there using the latest technology in a form of transportation means  In education  the changes have brought advantages to students and teachers  For instance  students can do their homework or assignment faster because using Internet  The teachers also get some advantages from it  They can combine their teaching skill with it and produce some interesting materials to teach like colorful slides to deliver the lesson and animation to show how things happen  In conclusion  technology itself has given us advantages to improve our life’s quality 
Technology has become ever present in different aspects of our lives  but most increasingly in our education system and for the student in these schools  This can be seen by the increased amount of technology that each student posses – from smart phones  to iPods  and iPads  As well as the increased amount of technology in the classrooms themselves – from smart boards to computer labs and online classes  While some of this increased technology can have disadvantages like cyber bulling  sexting  and plagiarism  the advantages technology has in the education system greatly out ways these  Evolving technology in schools helps disabled kids attend school with minimal aid  helps prepare students for using technology in the real world  and helps expand the students’ ability to obtain more knowledge about the world 

            The new advances in technology have helped students with both physical and mental disabilities be able to attend school easier  New innovations in wheelchairs have allowed students with physical disabilities to participate in sports with their fellow students  Wheelchairs have been created so students can partake in track and field and other sports like basketball  Casey Followay of Wooster  Ohio  is an example of a student using a racing wheelchair that also him to race in his high schools track team  As well as wheelchairs  new speaking devices  like the electronic pointing device and sip and puff system  have been invited to allow students with speaking and physical impairments to be able to communicate   The electronic pointing device allows the student to control the curser on a computer screen without the use of their hands  The sip and puff system is activated instead by inhaling or exhaling  Theses devices can be used in conjecture with a computer program that speaks out commands  comments or words  allowing the participant to speak and communicate with other students and teachers  Furthermore  cochlear implants permit students who are profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing to partake in school discussions and classes  The device and the microphone the teacher wears allow the student to hear and understand speech better  making it possible for them be more independent in school and classes  All these devices allow students to be able to have greater interaction with their teachers and fellow classmates  

            New advances in technology also prepare students for the real world  whether it is for a future job or investing and saving the money they will make from their jobs  In many classes – Effective Writing to World History 101 – students use programs like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint to write their essays and to create presentations  When I visited my uncle  a financier  I saw first hand how necessary these computer programs were in his day to day job  Also  in my high school business class we used computers to keep track of the stock market and trades  Each student had a excel sheet that they used to keep track of the stock market and an investing program to learn how to invest in the stock market  By learning as students how to use the computer to invest and trade we will be better equipped as adults to invest in stock markets and to keep track of our funds and investments  Furthermore  in my photography classes I – an advance photographer – used computers to learn how to create digital art and graphic art  Later on these skills will become useful for creating business cards  posters or designing something for a job or business  For example my mother – an event organizer – uses digital art skills to create posters and invitations for companies’ events  Through all these opportunities in classes to use technology  students can use their knowledge to further themselves in the workforce and for when they are adults in their everyday lives  

            Advancing technology has expanded students’ opportunities to interact with the world and learn vast amounts of knowledge  Students can Skype with people around the world; just like many Loyola students have Skyped with students in Spain to practice their Spanish  This allows for Loyola students  as well as other students who do this  to learn the culture and language of another ethnicity and country first hand  This makes the student become more cultivated and open to other countries and cultures  Because of the vast amount of information online  students are able to gain larger amounts of knowledge  Students are able to learn vast amounts of details about events that are happening all around the world  For example because of social media  people in places like Syria and Egypt were able to interact and let the world know first hand what was happening during the revolts  Without technology this information would never have been accessed by the millions of people and students worldwide   Also  students can publish their work online  allowing for students to become published authors and to get critic and credit for their work  In my Understanding Literature class my fellow classmates and I have published our writing on a blog for others to read  but also as well to allow us to read our classmates work  By doing so we are able to more actively partake in class and connect our insights with the insights our fellow classmates have in their writings  

            Technology will always be evolving and advancing  It will continue to make life easier for disabled students  make students more prepared for future jobs  and more intellectual about the world as a whole  Technology and the education system will always go hand in hand now that we live in technology influence world and society   It will be up to our generation to make sure that these innovations in technology continue to evolve to fit the needs of people and to be used to make life better  especially for students 
From the alarm clock in the morning to the entertainment center at night  everyday life is improved  The automatic coffee maker has the coffee ready at a certain time  Cars or public transportation bring people to work where computers operate at the push of a button  At home  there’s the convenience of washing machines and dryers  dishwashers  air conditioners  and power lawn mowers  Modern technology has made life better with many conveniences  Not only has technology improved our lives through convenience  it has improved lives through efficiency  The time saved by machines doing most of the work leaves more time for people to develop their personal goals or to just relax  Years ago  when doing laundry could take all day  there wasn’t time left over to read or go to school or even just to take a leisurely walk  Nowadays  people have more time and energy than ever to simply enjoy their lives and pursue their goals thanks to the efficiency of modern technology  Thesis Statement May summarize proof Introduction Background Not proof Body (Proof) One reason that thesis is right Body (Proof) Another reason your thesis is right Your last name 2 Accessibility to a wide range of options has been expanded through modern technology  Never before could people cross a continent or an ocean in an afternoon  Travel is not the only way technology has created accessibility  Software which types from voice commands has made using computers more accessible for school or work  People with special needs have many new options thanks to modern technology such as special chairs or text readers  Actually  those people who need hearing aids as a result of normal aging have access to continued communication and enjoyment of entertainment they did not previously have  There are many ways technology has improved lives through increased accessibility  Modern technology has created many conveniences in everyday life from waking up to music to having coffee ready to getting to work and doing a day’s work  The efficiency provided by technology gives people more time to enjoy life and pursue personal development  and the accessibility has broadened options for travel  school  and work  Lives have been improved with modern technology through convenience  efficiency  and accessibility 
The technological singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial general intelligence (constituting  for example  intelligent computers  computer networks  or robots) would be capable of recursive self improvement (progressively redesigning itself)  or of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful machines than itself  up to the point of a runaway effect—an intelligence explosion—that yields an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding  Because the capabilities of such as super intelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend  the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence  
It is important to note that the definition of a "scientific theory" (often ambiguously contracted to "theory" for the sake of brevity  including in this page) as used in the disciplines of science is significantly different from  and in contrast to  the common vernacular usage of the word "theory"  As used in everyday non scientific speech  "theory" implies that something is an unsubstantiated and speculative guess  conjecture  or hypothesis; such a usage is the opposite of a scientific theory  These different usages are comparable to the differing  and often opposing  usages of the term "prediction" in science (less ambiguously called a "scientific prediction") versus "prediction" in non scientific vernacular speech  the latter of which may even imply a mere hope 
Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications  and some are highly specialized to specific tasks  For example  relational databases commonly use B tree indexes for data retrieval  while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers 
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services  Usually  efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms  Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures  rather than algorithms  as the key organizing factor in software design  Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and in secondary memory 
Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits  Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science  such as computer algorithms  programming languages  cryptography  automated theorem proving  and software development  Conversely  computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real world problems  such as in operations research 
Combinatorics studies the way in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged  Enumerative combinatorics concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects   e g  the twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations  combinations and partitions  Analytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration (i e   determining the number) of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory  In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions to describe the results  analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic formulae  Design theory is a study of combinatorial designs  which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties  Partition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to integer partitions  and is closely related to q series  special functions and orthogonal polynomials  Originally a part of number theory and analysis  partition theory is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field  Order theory is the study of partially ordered sets  both finite and infinite 
Graph theory

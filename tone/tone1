Peacefulness is an inner sense of calm   it comes from becoming still   in
order to reflect and meditate on our inner wisdom and receive answers  A
peaceful heart is one that is free from worry and trouble  It s becoming quiet
so we can look at things quietly so we can more clearly understand them and
thus come up with creative solutions  It is learning to live in the present  
Be anxious for nothing  but in everything by prayer and supplication  with thanksgiving  let your requests be made known to God  and the peace of God  which surpasses all understanding  will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus  
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking  but of righteousness  peace and joy in the Holy Spirit  18 because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval  19 Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification 

 Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing 
and rightdoing there is a field 
I ll meet you there 

When the soul lies down in that grass
the world is too full to talk about 

When I say it s you I like  I m talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch  That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive  Love that conquers hate  peace that rises triumphant over war  and justice that proves more powerful than greed   

When Great Trees Fall

When great trees fall 
rocks on distant hills shudder 
lions hunker down
in tall grasses 
and even elephants
lumber after safety 

When great trees fall
in forests 
small things recoil into silence 
their senses
eroded beyond fear 

When great souls die 
the air around us becomes
light  rare  sterile 
We breathe  briefly 
Our eyes  briefly 
see with
a hurtful clarity 
Our memory  suddenly sharpened 
examines 
gnaws on kind words
unsaid 
promised walks
never taken 

Great souls die and
our reality  bound to
them  takes leave of us 
Our souls 
dependent upon their
nurture 
now shrink  wizened 
Our minds  formed
and informed by their
radiance 
fall away 
We are not so much maddened
as reduced to the unutterable ignorance
of dark  cold
caves 

And when great souls die 
after a period peace blooms 
slowly and always
irregularly  Spaces fill
with a kind of
soothing electric vibration 
Our senses  restored  never
to be the same  whisper to us 
They existed  They existed 
We can be  and 
better  For they existed   

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o er vales and hills 
When all at once I saw a crowd 
A host  of golden daffodils 
Beside the lake  beneath the trees 
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze 

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way 
They stretched in never ending line
Along the margin of a bay  
Ten thousand saw I at a glance 
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance 

The waves beside them danced  but they
Out did the sparkling waves in glee 
A poet could not but be gay 
In such a jocund company 
I gazed  and gazed  but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought 

For oft  when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood  
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude 
And then my heart with pleasure fills 
And dances with the daffodils   


 But the Mahommedan religion increases  instead of lessening  the fury of intolerance  It was originally propagated by the sword  and ever since  its votaries have been subject  above the people of all other creeds  to this form of madness  In a moment the fruits of patient toil  the prospects of material prosperity  the fear of death itself  are flung aside  The more emotional Pathans are powerless to resist  All rational considerations are forgotten  Seizing their weapons  they become Ghazis as dangerous and as sensible as mad dogs  fit only to be treated as such  While the more generous spirits among the tribesmen become convulsed in an ecstasy of religious bloodthirstiness  poorer and more material souls derive additional impulses from the influence of others  the hopes of plunder and the joy of fighting  Thus whole nations are roused to arms  Thus the Turks repel their enemies  the Arabs of the Soudan break the British squares  and the rising on the Indian frontier spreads far and wide  In each case civilisation is confronted with militant Mahommedanism  The forces of progress clash with those of reaction  The religion of blood and war is face to face with that of peace   


When despair for the world grows in me
and I wake in the night at the least sound
in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be 
I go and lie down where the wood drake
rests in his beauty on the water  and the great heron feeds 
I come into the peace of wild things
who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief  I come into the presence of still water 
And I feel above me the day blind stars
waiting with their light  For a time
I rest in the grace of the world  and am free   

Our bodies have five senses  touch  smell  taste  sight  hearing  But not to be overlooked are the senses of our souls  intuition  peace  foresight  trust  empathy  The differences between people lie in their use of these senses  most people don t know anything about the inner senses while a few people rely on them just as they rely on their physical senses  and in fact probably even more   
 If you don t want a man unhappy politically  don t give him two sides to a question to worry him  give him one  Better yet  give him none  Let him forget there is such a thing as war  If the government is inefficient  top heavy  and tax mad  better it be all those than that people worry over it  Peace  Montag  Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year  Cram them full of noncombustible data  chock them so damned full of  facts  they feel stuffed  but absolutely  brilliant  with information  Then they ll feel they re thinking  they ll get a sense of motion without moving  And they ll be happy  because facts of that sort don t change   

 Every person needs to take one day away   A day in which one consciously separates the past from the future   Jobs  family  employers  and friends can exist one day without any one of us  and if our egos permit us to confess  they could exist eternally in our absence   Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted  no solutions searched for   Each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us   

The Simple Path
Silence is Prayer
Prayer is Faith
Faith is Love
Love is Service
The Fruit of Service is Peace

For Equilibrium  a Blessing 
Like the joy of the sea coming home to shore 
May the relief of laughter rinse through your soul 
As the wind loves to call things to dance 
May your gravity by lightened by grace 
Like the dignity of moonlight restoring the earth 
May your thoughts incline with reverence and respect 
As water takes whatever shape it is in 
So free may you be about who you become 
As silence smiles on the other side of what s said 
May your sense of irony bring perspective 
As time remains free of all that it frames 
May your mind stay clear of all it names 
May your prayer of listening deepen enough
to hear in the depths the laughter of god 

The mind can go in a thousand directions  but on this beautiful path  I walk in peace  With each step  the wind blows  With each step  a flower blooms 

That was when it was all made painfully clear to me  When you are a child  there is joy  There is laughter  And most of all  there is trust  Trust in your fellows  When you are an adult   then comes suspicion  hatred  and fear  If children ran the world  it would be a place of eternal bliss and cheer  Adults run the world  and there is war  and enmity  and destruction unending  Adults who take charge of things muck them up  and then produce a new generation of children and say   The children are the hope of the future   And they are right  Children are the hope of the future  But adults are the damnation of the present  and children become adults as surely as adults become worm food  
Adults are the death of hope   

Happiness  true happiness  is an inner quality  It is a state of mind  If your mind is at peace  you are happy  If your mind is at peace  but you have nothing else  you can be happy  If you have everything the world can give   pleasure  possessions  power   but lack peace of mind  you can never be happy 

To enjoy good health  to bring true happiness to one s family  to bring peace to all  one must first discipline and control one s own mind  If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment  and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him

The most important thing is to enjoy your life   to be happy   it s all that matters 
I believe in pink  I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner  I believe in kissing  kissing a lot  I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong  I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls  I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles 

A birthday is just another day where you go to work and people give you love  Age is just a state of mind  and you are as old as you think you are  You have to count your blessings and be happy  

 We begin from the recognition that all beings cherish happiness and do not want suffering  It then becomes both morally wrong and pragmatically unwise to pursue only one’s own happiness oblivious to the feelings and aspirations of all others who surround us as members of the same human family  The wiser course is to think of others when pursuing our own happiness  

 The pleasure which we most rarely experience gives us greatest delight  

 Happiness is not in the mere possession of money  it lies in the joy of achievement  in the thrill of creative effort  
 Happiness is not in the mere possession of money  it lies in the joy of achievement  in the thrill of creative effort  

The only thing that will make you happy is being happy with who you are  and not who people think you are 


HAPPY

Live Life Happy   In case no one told you today  you're beautiful  you're loved  you're needed  you're alive  for a reason  you're stronger than you think 
Happiness is when what you think  what you say  and what you do are in harmony 
Happiness is not something readymade  It comes from your own actions 
     
Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life  and that happiness  not pain or mindless self indulgence  is the proof of your moral integrity  since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values 
     
Happiness cannot be travelled to  owned  earned  worn or consumed  Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love  grace  and gratitude 
     
Try to make at least one person happy every day  If you cannot do a kind deed  speak a kind word  If you cannot speak a kind word  think a kind thought  Count up  if you can  the treasure of happiness that you would dispense in a week  in a year  in a lifetime!
     
Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us  but is always the result of a good conscience  good health  occupation  and freedom in all just pursuits 
     
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts  therefore  guard accordingly  and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature 
      
Happiness is inward  and not outward; and so  it does not depend on what we have  but on what we are 
      
Happiness is as a butterfly which  when pursued is always beyond our grasp  but if you sit down quietly may alight upon you  
Where your pleasure is  there is your treasure where your treasure  there your heart; where your heart  there your happiness  
 Love is knowing you are the bud from which his happiness blossoms 
Nothing brings me more happiness than trying to help the most vulnerable people in society  It is a goal and an essential part of my life   a kind of destiny  Whoever is in distress can call on me  I will come running wherever they are 
     
Happiness is spiritual  born of truth and love  It is unselfish; therefore it cannot exist alone  but requires all mankind to share it 
     
Love is the most terrible  and also the most generous of the passions; it is the only one which includes in its dreams the happiness of someone else 
     
Happiness exists on earth  and it is won through prudent exercise of reason  knowledge of the harmony of the universe  and constant practice of generosity 
     
Happy is he who still loves something he loved in the nursery  He has not been broken in two by time; he is not two men  but one  and he has saved not only his soul but his life
     
Joy  rather than happiness  is the goal of life  for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings  It is based on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity 
      

Joy  rather than happiness  is the goal of life  for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings  It is based on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity 
      
Happiness includes chiefly the idea of satisfaction after full honest effort  No one can possibly be satisfied and no one can be happy who feels that in some paramount affairs he failed to take up the challenge of life 
      
Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one's values 
 Happiness must be cultivated  It is like character  It is not a thing to be safely let alone for a moment  or it will run to weeds 
    
For happiness one needs security  but joy can spring like a flower even from the cliffs of despair 
    
Happiness must be cultivated  It is like character  It is not a thing to be safely let alone for a moment  or it will run to weeds 
    
Most of us believe in trying to make other people happy only if they can be happy in ways which we approve 
    
True happiness    is not attained through self gratification  but through fidelity to a worthy purpose  
    
I have discovered the secret of happiness   it is work  either with the hands or the head  The moment I have something to do  the draughts are open and my chimney draws  and I am happy 
  
I always say: 'Share your happiness with the world  give other people that happiness and let it come back ' but some things make me question it  I don't know if I want some people to know that I am happy 

If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured  it may never arrive  Mountains will not be climbed  races won  or lasting happiness achieved 
    
Happiness is dependent on self discipline  We are the biggest obstacles to our own happiness  It is much easier to do battle with society and with others than to fight our own nature 
    
Happiness is dependent on self discipline  We are the biggest obstacles to our own happiness  It is much easier to do battle with society and with others than to fight our own nature 
    
The art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things 
    
Happiness in this world  when it comes  comes incidentally  Make it the object of pursuit  and it leads us a wild goose chase  and is never attained  Follow some other object  and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it 
    
If you have easy self contentment  you might have a very  very cheap source of happiness 
    
To enjoy good health  to bring true happiness to one's family  to bring peace to all  one must first discipline and control one's own mind  If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment  and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him 
    
Happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best 
    
Today I choose life  Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy  happiness  negativity  pain    To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices   today I choose to feel life  not to deny my humanity but embrace it 
    
Every day we have plenty of opportunities to get angry  stressed or offended  But what you're doing when you indulge these negative emotions is giving something outside yourself power over your happiness  You can choose to not let little things upset you 
    
You take away all the other luxuries in life  and if you can make someone smile and laugh  you have given the most special gift: happiness 
    
Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present  
 It's great to reminisce about good memories of my past  It was enjoyable when it was today  So learning to enjoy today has two benefits: it gives me happiness right now  and it becomes a good memory later 
    
Red is such an interesting color to correlate with emotion  because it's on both ends of the spectrum  On one end you have happiness  falling in love  infatuation with someone  passion  all that 
    
Happiness  true happiness  is an inner quality  It is a state of mind  If your mind is at peace  you are happy  If your mind is at peace  but you have nothing else  you can be happy  If you have everything the world can give   pleasure  possessions  power   but lack peace of mind  you can never be happy 
    


It is very important to generate a good attitude  a good heart  as much as possible  From this  happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come 

There is joy in work  There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something 
    
Happiness is a butterfly  which when pursued  is always just beyond your grasp  but which  if you will sit down quietly  may alight upon you 
    
I try to be a good daughter  as I believe in karma and feel that how you are with your parents is directly proportionate to what you receive in your life  I am a big oneness follower  and our gurus have told us that if you want to achieve external happiness  you need to be happy internally  And your inner circle is your family 
    
In this life  we have to make many choices  Some are very important choices  Some are not  Many of our choices are between good and evil  The choices we make  however  determine to a large extent our happiness or our unhappiness  because we have to live with the consequences of our choices 
    
Happiness is having a large  loving  caring  close knit family in another city 
    
Happiness is in our own hearts  I have no regrets of anything in the past  I'm totally cheerful and happy  and I think that a lot of your attitude is not in the circumstances you find yourself in  but in the circumstances you make for yourself 
    
The Lord protects  guides  and watches over those who are His trusted friends in His work  His work and that of His Father and our Father is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of the children of God  And Satan  the enemy of our happiness  opposes those who serve the Lord 
    
The world tells us in a thousand different ways that the bigger we become  the freer we will be  The richer  the more beautiful  and the more powerful we grow  the more security  liberty  and happiness we will experience  And yet  the gospel tells us just the opposite  that the smaller we become  the freer we will be

Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own    Jealousy is a disease  love is a healthy condition  The immature mind often mistakes one for the other  or assumes that the greater the love  the greater the jealousy 
    
The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include  as necessary to one's own happiness  the happiness of others 
    
Man falls from the pursuit of the ideal of plan living and high thinking the moment he wants to multiply his daily wants  Man's happiness really lies in contentment 
    
Success does not mean happiness  Check out any celebrity magazine to look for examples to disabuse you of thinking that being beautiful  successful or rich will make you happy 
    
Happiness is a critical factor for work  and work is a critical factor for happiness  In one of those life isn't fair results  it turns out that the happy outperform the less happy  Happy people work more hours each week   and they work more in their free time  too 
    
Happiness is an imaginary condition  formerly attributed by the living to the dead  now usually attributed by adults to children  and by children to adults 
    
Wisdom allows nothing to be good that will not be so forever; no man to be happy but he that needs no other happiness than what he has within himself; no man to be great or powerful that is not master of himself 
    
Man's only true happiness is to live in hope of something to be won by him  Reverence something to be worshipped by him  and love something to be cherished by him  forever

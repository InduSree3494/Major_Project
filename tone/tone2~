Technology is just a tool  In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them  the teacher is the most important 
The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do  It lets people be creative  It lets people be productive  It lets people learn things they didn t think they could learn before  and so in a sense it is all about potential 
Technology gives us power  but it does not and cannot tell us how to use that power  Thanks to technology  we can instantly communicate across the world  but it still doesn t help us know what to say 
Technology is supposed to make our lives easier  allowing us to do things more quickly and efficiently  But too often it seems to make things harder  leaving us with fifty button remote controls  digital cameras with hundreds of mysterious features and book length manuals  and cars with dashboard systems worthy of the space shuttle 

Cell phones  mobile e mail  and all the other cool and slick gadgets can cause massive losses in our creative output and overall productivity 
The new electronic independence re creates the world in the image of a global village 

Technology is such a broad kind of term  it really applies to so many things  from the electric light to running cars on oil  All of these different things can be called technology  I have kind of a love hate relationship with it  as I expect most people do  With the computer  I spend so many hours sitting in front of a computer 
The most important and urgent problems of the technology of today are no longer the satisfactions of the primary needs or of archetypal wishes  but the reparation of the evils and damages by the technology of yesterday 

Cyberspace  A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators  in every nation  by children being taught mathematical concepts 

The digital camera is a great invention because it allows us to reminisce  Instantly 

The Internet is the most important single development in the history of human communication since the invention of call waiting 
The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them 
Medical knowledge and technical savvy are biodegradable  The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack 
The most technologically efficient machine that man has ever invented is the book  Just because something doesn t do what you planned it to do doesn t mean it s useless It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity 
One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men  No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man 
Technology frightens me to death  It s designed by engineers to impress other engineers  And they always come with instruction booklets that are written by engineers for other engineers   which is why almost no technology ever works 
The greatest achievement of humanity is not its works of art  science  or technology  but the recognition of its own dysfunction 
First we thought the PC was a calculator  Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII   and we thought it was a typewriter  Then we discovered graphics  and we thought it was a television  With the World Wide Web  we ve realized it s a brochure 

Programs must be written for people to read  and only incidentally for machines to execute

***MOTIVATING***
Each step you take toward a bigger goal might not seem like much. It may seem like you’re not really doing much at all. This will be especially true of any outside observers. Others might think you’re not getting anywhere, that you’re not getting anything done. That’s why you have to have a lot of confidence in where you’re going. You need to be clear about where you want to end up so that you have the conviction that the small steps you are taking will eventually get you to where you want to be, and you can squash any naysayers.

here is no one That can be better Because you are brilliant. There is nothing That you cannot you do Because you are unbeatable. There is no place That you cannot go Because you are always welcomed. There is no person That can hold you back Because you are unstoppable.

Often you feel you’ve done nothing when you’ve actually done a lot. That’s because what you did do seemed beneath notice—it was so small that it didn’t “count.” But it did—just as each stitch counts toward a finished dress, each brick or nail toward a house you can live in, each mistake toward knowing how to do things right.

***FEAR***
“It’s watchin’ us” Ralphie whispered.
“Listen, I’m not gonna-”
“No, Danny. Really. Can’t you feel it?”
Danny stopped. And in the way of children, he did feel something and knew they were no longer alone. A great hush had fallen over the woods; but it was a malefic hush. Shadows, urged by the wind, twisted languorously around them.


It was A LOW, DULL, QUICK SOUND -- MUCH SUCH A SOUND AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON. I gasped for breath, and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly, more vehemently but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why WOULD they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men, but the noise steadily increased. O God! What COULD I do? I foamed -- I raved -- I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder -- louder -- louder!

The night it happened was one we will never forget. The wind was screeching outside as rain pounded against the window. We had lost electricity hours ago and had nothing but candles to light the house. The battery powered radio we had was broadcasting a warning to lock your doors and stay inside; there was a killer on the loose.

What’s the matter with those idiots in the city council? First they pass new parking regulations saying we can’t park our cars in front of our own houses without a special permit. Now they’ve gone and slapped another tax on gas purchase—just to widen a road that’s already wide enough. Anyway, nobody enjoys the traffic delays resulting from road construction. The sooner we vote those incompetents out, the better off we’ll all be.


Hundreds of colleges now require their students to lease or buy a laptop computer. The theory is that the computers will help students do research and increase their chances for interactive learning. Yet in many classrooms, laptops have become more of an obstacle than an enhancement to learning, and professors need to think seriously about prohibiting their use during class time. Many students who bring their computers to class do not use them to take lecture notes or refer to web sites for more information about the professor’s lecture topic. Far from it. In the history classes I teach, many laptop users don’t even pretend to pay attention to my lecture or to participate in the discussion. They are more inclined to visit networking sites like MySpace; e-mail or instant message their friends, and even shop online. No wonder, then, that so many of them have ended up with low grades or are flunking out altogether. Many of these same kids no longer know how to produce an original thought on their own. Ask them a question and they search the Internet rather than think. For me, this was the last straw. Laptops, like cell phones, have no place in my classroom until someone can prove to me that they really are the great boon to education I have been promised.


***HAPPY***
 When labor is light and the morning is fair, I find it a pleasure beyond all compare To hitch up my nag1 and go hurrying down and take Katie May for a ride into town;  For bumpety-bump goes the wagon, But tra-la-la-la our lay. There's joy in a song as we rattle along In the light of the glorious day. A coach would be fine, but a spring wagon's good; My jeans are a match for Kate's gingham2 and hood; The hills take us up and the vales3 take us down, But what matters that? we are riding to town, And bumpety-bump goes the wagon,  But tra-la-la-la sing we. There's never a care may live in the air That is filled with the breath of our glee.


How could I love you more? I try to think of one lovely gift  No lover yet in all the world has found; I think: If the cold somber1 gods Were hot with love as I am Could they not endow2 you with a star And fix bright youth forever in your limbs? Could they not give you all things that I lack?  You should have loved a god; I am but dust. Yet no god loves as loves this poor frail dust.

The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it's all that matters.

***TECHNOLOGY***
The advancement of technology generally evokes a range of emotions in people from all walks of life.  Some view technology as a great evil that slowly diminishes our humanity, while others view it as a way to bring the world closer together and to help solve some of our greatest challenges.  Regardless of your view, almost everyone has a favorite quote or two about the impact that technology has on our lives.

First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII — and we thought it was a typewriter. Then we discovered graphics, and we thought it was a television. With the World Wide Web, we've realized it's a brochure.

Information technology (IT) is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data,often in the context of a business or other enterprise.[2] IT is considered a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). In 2012, Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level "contain some degree of commonality in that they are related to technologies that facilitate the transfer of information and various types of electronically mediated communications.".Business/IT was one level of the ICT hierarchy.

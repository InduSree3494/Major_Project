I am disturbed by how states abuse laws on Internet access  I am concerned that surveillance programmes are becoming too aggressive  I understand that national security and criminal activity may justify some exceptional and narrowly tailored use of surveillance  But that is all the more reason to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms 
Wolves and women are relational by nature  inquiring  possessed of great endurance and strength  They are deeply intuitive  intensely concerned with their young  their mate and their pack  Yet both have been hounded  harassed and falsely imputed to be devouring and devious  overly aggressive  of less value than those who are their detractors 

Oh Jerusalem  the city of sorrow
A big tear wandering in the eye
Who will halt the aggression 
On you  the pearl of religions 
Who will wash your bloody walls 
Who will safeguard the Bible 
Who will rescue the Quran 
Who will save Christ  
From those who have killed Christ 
Who will save man 
aggression
On you  the pearl of religions 
Who will wash your bloody walls 
Who will safeguard the Bible 
Who will rescue the Quran 
Who will save Christ  From those who have killed Christ 
Who will save man 
Oh Jerusalem my town
Oh Jerusalem my love
Tomorrow the lemon trees will blossom
And the olive trees will rejoice
Your eyes will dance
The migrant pigeons will return
To your sacred roofs
And your children will play again
And fathers and sons will meet
On your rosy hills
My town
The town of peace and olives

Mother Fuckers  They re going to feel pretty stupid when they find out 
They re fucking with the wrong people   
 
 We are only just beginning to understand the power of love because we are just beginning to understand the weakness of force and aggression   

 There are few genuine conservatives within the U S  political system  and it is a sign of the intellectual corruption of the age that the honorable term  conservatism  can be appropriated to disguise the advocacy of a powerful  lawless  aggressive and violent state  a welfare state for the rich dedicated to a lunatic form ofKeynesian economic intervention that enhances state and private power while mortgaging the country s future   

 When a man has a gift in speaking the truth  brute aggression is no longer his security blanket for approval  He  on the contrary  spends most of his energy trying to tone it down because his very nature is already offensive enough  

Why give a robot an order to obey orders why aren t the original orders enough  Why command a robot not to do harm wouldn t it be easier never to command it to do harm in the first place  Does the universe contain a mysterious force pulling entities toward malevolence  so that a positronic brain must be programmed to withstand it  Do intelligent beings inevitably develop an attitude problem      Now that computers really have become smarter and more powerful  the anxiety has waned  Today s ubiquitous  networked computers have an unprecedented ability to do mischief should they ever go to the bad  But the only mayhem comes from unpredictable chaos or from human malice in the form of viruses  We no longer worry about electronic serial killers or subversive silicon cabals because we are beginning to appreciate that malevolence like vision  motor coordination  and common sense does not come free with computation but has to be programmed in      Aggression  like every other part of human behavior we take for granted  is a challenging engineering problem!  

It would be well to realize that the talk of  humane methods of warfare   of the  rules of civilized warfare   and all such homage to the finer sentiments of the race are hypocritical and unreal  and only intended for the consumption of stay at homes  There are no humane methods of warfare  there is no such thing as civilized warfare  all warfare is inhuman  all warfare is barbaric  the first blast of the bugles of war ever sounds for the time being the funeral knell of human progress  What lover of humanity can view with anything but horror the prospect of this ruthless destruction of human life  Yet this is war  war for which all the jingoes are howling  war to which all the hopes of the world are being sacrificed  war to which a mad ruling class would plunge a mad world   
Women particularly should concern themselves with peace because men by nature are more foolhardy and headstrong  and their overwhelming desire to avenge themselves prevents them from foreseeing the resulting dangers and terrors of war  But woman by nature is more gentle and circumspect  Therefore  if she has sufficient will and wisdom she can provide the best possible means to pacify man   
There can be no socialism without a state  and as long as there is a state there is socialism  The state  then  is the very institution that puts socialism into action  and as socialism rests on aggressive violence directed against innocent victims  aggressive violence is the nature of any state   

Not all dogs are perfect dogs  but all dogs are inherently good  Like people  we are affected by environment and circumstance  Some breeds get a bad rap because sometimes humans breed them to be a certain way  like overly macho or protective  In our life on earth we are dependent on humans for everything  including our breeding  We can be bred for aggression or we can be bred for peace 

Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace  and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood  If this is to be achieved  man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge  aggression and retaliation  The foundation of such a method is love 

Aggression is a biological response to a life threatening situation  When there is an immediate threat to life  aggressive energy provides the power to do what needs to be done  Aggression in normal daily interactions is like activating a smoke alarm when there is no smoke  Actually  it is worse  The ringing alarm would be annoying  but it would do no harm  Aggression at best is annoying  and at worst  itself  becomes life threatening 

Aggression is part of the masculine design  we are hardwired for it     Little girls do not invent games where large numbers of people die  where bloodshed is a prerequisite for having fun  Hockey  for example  was not a feminine creation  Nor was boxing  A boy wants to attack something    and so does a man  even if it s only a little white ball on a tee 
The fact that bad is stronger than good is nowhere more apparent than in acts of violence and aggression  This principle is sometimes called the magnitude gap  referring to one important difference between the perpetrator and the victim  Almost inevitably  the victim loses more than the perpetrator gains  Aggression is thus not just a simple transfer or exchange  it lowers the total value available 

Aggression is different from anger  Anger is an emotion  aggression is a behavior  There are better ways to deal with anger than behaving aggressively  Aggressive talk  gestures or behaviors belong to the old way of being  Once we tune in to a higher level of consciousness  aggression is as unnecessary as is the hand held plow in modern day agriculture 

Our people went out every single night trying to stop crime before it happened  trying to take people off the street that they believed were involved in crime  That made us a very aggressive  proactive police department 

What makes anyone think that government officials are even trying to protect us  A government is not analogous to a hired security guard  Governments do not come into existence as social service organizations or as private firms seeking to please consumers in a competitive market  Instead  they are born in conquest and nourished by plunder  They are  in short  well armed gangs intent on organized crime  Yes  rulers have sometimes come to recognize the prudence of protecting the herd they are milking and even of improving its  infrastructure  until the day they decide to slaughter the young bulls  but the idea that government officials seek to promote my interests or yours is little more than propaganda unless  of course  you happen to belong to the class of privileged tax eaters who give significant support to the government and therefore receive in return a share of the loot   

If any man s money can be taken by a so called government  without his own personal consent  all his other rights are taken with it  for with his money the government can  and will  hire soldiers to stand over him  compel him to submit to its arbitrary will  and kill him if he resists

t s about the ways in which girls deal with anger and aggression  as opposed to the ways in which boys do  The premise is that boys tend to be more direct in their aggression   physical confrontation   while in contrast  girls use an indirect approach known as relational aggression  Relational aggression is a form of aggression where the group is used as a weapon to assault others and others  relationships  It uses lies  secrets  betrayals and a host of other two faced tactics to destroy or damage the relationships and social standing of others in the group   

As for children s working off aggressions  I m against it  They are going to need all the aggressions they can contain for ultimate release in the adult world  Name one great man in history who did not go boiling and bubbling through childhood with a lashed down safety valve 

Om is the presence which steals away  It steals away the ordinary mundane existence of strife  struggle and duality  it steals away anxiety  aggression  fear  grief and sorrow  it steals away the debris of anger  hatred  confusion and ignorance  to fill us with the nectar of joy  immortality and life eternal   



 Maybe you receive pain selfishly   thinking only of yourself  The cycle of pain wounds every participant  both victim and aggressor   


 A society that presumes a norm of violence and celebrates aggression  whether in the subway  on the football field  or in the conduct of its business  cannot help making celebrities of the people who would destroy it    
 Aggression like this demanded slinging the first punch in a bar brawl  firing rounds at a range  or setting a car on fire 

I will care a little less about some things   Learning to Care Less about the Disapproval of Others   Sophisticated people use passive aggressive means of coercion  That way they can get what they want without having to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing they bullied someone else into doing what they wanted  Extra points if you can be so subtle and skillful at justifying your actions that you even fool yourself  

Toxic people often hide cleverly behind passive aggression    Instead of openly expressing how they feel  someone makes subtle  annoying gestures directed at you  Instead of saying what s actually upsetting them  they find small and petty ways to take jabs at you until you pay attention and get upset  Obviously this is a toxic relationship situation

Are We Hard Wired for War 
The emerging popular consensus about our biological predisposition to warfare is troubling: it is scientifically weak and morally unfortunate 
WAR is in the air  Sad to say  there’s nothing new about this  Nor is there anything new about the claim that war has always been with us  and always will be 
What is new  it seems  is the degree to which this claim is wrapped in the apparent acquiescence of science  especially the findings of evolutionary biology with respect to a war prone “human nature ”
This year  an article in The National Interest titled “What Our Primate Relatives Say About War” answered the question “Why war ” with “Because we are human ” In recent years  a piece in New Scientist asserted that warfare has “played an integral part in our evolution” and an article in the journal Science claimed that “death in warfare is so common in hunter gatherer societies that it was an important evolutionary pressure on early Homo sapiens ”
The emerging popular consensus about our biological predisposition to warfare is troubling  It is not just scientifically weak; it is also morally unfortunate  as it fosters an unjustifiably limited vision of human potential 
Although there is considerable reason to think that at least some of our hominin ancestors engaged in warlike activities  there is also comparable evidence that others did not  While it is plausible that Homo sapiens owed much of its rapid brain evolution to natural selection’s favoring individuals that were smart enough to defeat their human rivals in violent competition  it is also plausible that we became highly intelligent because selection favored those of our ancestors who were especially adroit at communicating and cooperating 
Conflict avoidance  reconciliation and cooperative problem solving could also have been altogether “biological” and positively selected for 
Chimpanzees  we now know  engage in something distressingly akin to human warfare  but bonobos  whose evolutionary lineage makes them no more distant from us than chimps  are justly renowned for making love instead  For many anthropologists  “man the hunter” remains a potent trope  yet at the same time  other anthropologists embrace “woman the gatherer ” not to mention the cooperator  peacemaker and child rearer 
When  in the 1960s and ’70s  the anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon began reporting his findings concerning the Yanomamo people of the Amazon  whom he claimed lived in a state of persistent warfare  his data were eagerly embraced by many — including myself — because they represented such a beguilingly close fit to our predictions about the likely positive correlation between early human violence and evolutionary fitness 
In retrospect  even though I have no reason to doubt Yanomamo ferocity  at least under certain circumstances  I seriously question the penchant of observers (scientific and lay alike) to generalize from small samples of our unquestionably diverse species  especially about something as complex as war 
I have little doubt that the perspective of many evolutionary biologists and some biological anthropologists has been distorted by the seductive drama of “primitive human war ” Conflict avoidance and reconciliation — although no less “natural” or important — are considerably less attention grabbing Yet peacemaking is  if anything  more pronounced and widely distributed  especially among groups of nomadic foragers who are probably closest in ecological circumstance to our hominin ancestors  The Hadza people of Tanzania have interpersonal conflicts  get angry and sometimes fight  but they assuredly don’t make war and apparently never have  The Moriori people  original inhabitants of the Chatham Islands off the coast of New Zealand  employed several methods (including social ridicule) that prevented individual disputes from escalating into group versus group killings  The Batek of peninsular Malaysia consider overt violence and even aggressive coercion to be utterly unacceptable  viewing themselves and their larger social unit as inherently and necessarily peaceful 
The problem with envisioning Homo sapiens as inherently and irrevocably warlike isn’t simply that it is wrong  but also that it threatens to constrain our sense of whether peacemaking is possible and  accordingly  worth trying 
I am counseling neither greater nor lesser involvement in specific wars  But I urge that any such decisions not be based on a fatalistic  empirically invalid assumption about humanity’s warlike nature 
There is a story  believed to be of Cherokee origin  in which a girl is troubled by a recurring dream in which two wolves fight viciously  Seeking an explanation  she goes to her grandfather  highly regarded for his wisdom  who explains that there are two forces within each of us  struggling for supremacy  one embodying peace and the other  war  At this  the girl is even more distressed  and asks her grandfather who wins  His answer: “The one you feed ”  
The U S  military has launched a newly aggressive campaign of cyberattacks against militants with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  or ISIS  targeting the group's abilities to use social media and the Internet to recruit fighters and inspire followers  U S  officials told The Associated Press 
The surge of computer based military operations by U S  Cyber Command began shortly after Defense Secretary Ash Carter prodded commanders at Fort Meade  Maryland  last month to ramp up the fight against ISIS on the cyber front 
U S  officials confirmed that operations launched out of Fort Meade have focused on disrupting the group's online activities  The officials said the effort is getting underway as operators try a range of attacks to see what works and what doesn't  They declined to discuss details  other than to say that the attacks include efforts to prevent the group from distributing propaganda  videos  or other types of recruiting and messaging on social media sites such as Twitter  and across the Internet in general 
Other attacks could include attempts to stop insurgents from conducting financial or logistical transactions online The more aggressive attacks come after months of pressure from Carter  who has been frustrated with the belief that the Pentagon   and particularly Cyber Command   was losing the war in the cyber domain 
Late last year Carter met with commanders  telling them they had 30 days to bring him options for how the military could use its cyberwarfare capabilities against the group's deadly insurgency across Iraq and Syria  and spreading to Libya and Afghanistan  Officials said he told commanders that beefing up cyberwarfare against ISIS was a test for them  and that they should have both the capability and the will to wage the online war 
But the military cyber fight is limited by concerns within the intelligence agencies that blocking the group's Internet access could hurt intelligence gathering 
Officials familiar with Carter's meetings said the secretary was frustrated that as Cyber Command has grown and developed over the past several years  it was still focused on the cyberthreats from nations  such as Iran  Russia and China  rather than building a force to block the communications and propaganda campaigns of Internet savvy insurgents However  Lewis added  the U S  needs to be careful about disrupting the Internet to insure that attacks don't also affect civilian networks or systems needed for critical infrastructure and other public necessities 
U S  officials have long been stymied by militants' ability to use the Internet as a vehicle for inspiring so called lone wolf attackers in Western nations  radicalized after reading propaganda easily available online 
"Why should they be able to communicate  Why should they be using the Internet " Carter said during testimony before the defense appropriations subcommittee  "The Internet shouldn't be used for that purpose "
U S  military Twitter account hacked

The U S  has also struggled to defeat high tech encryption techniques used by ISIS and other groups to communicate  Experts have been working to find ways to defeat those programs 
Early on  its key focus was on defending military networks  which are probed and attacked millions of times a day  But defence leaders also argued at length over the emerging issues surrounding warfare and how it should be incorporated 
The Pentagon is building 133 cyber teams by 2018  including 27 that are designed for combat and will work with regional commands to support warfighting operations  There will be 68 teams assigned to defend Defense Department networks and systems  13 that would respond to major cyberattacks against the U S   and 25 support teams 


I am writing this letter to issue a complaint regarding recent recurring verbal aggression on the part of the Social Science teacher and my tutor  Mr  Smith  Everything started at the beginning of this year  when we were correcting an exercise about the Industrial Revolution  It was my turn to speak  so I presented my idea  which contradicted what he had taught in the previous lesson  He then started to speak quickly and aggressively to me  even shouting that I was “some kind of idiot” that didn’t deserve to be in that grade  When I tried to argue back  he said that he was the teacher  and that I was “nobody ” This is just one of many examples of his abuse in the classroom  I’ve spoken with other members of the class and found similar levels of discomfort with his behavior  I have already asked for help from the Head of Studies and my parents  but all of them thought I was exaggerating and Mr  Smith was not the source of the problem  This is the very first time I’ve struggled with a teacher at school  which I have been attending for the past four years  I ask you for immediate action since I am afraid of this situation escalating into serious consequences if you don’t do anything  I would be happy to have a meeting with you to answer any questions and provide more details about this problem 

I regret to inform you that I will be giving my 14 day notice to resign as of today's date 
Thank you  so much  for all the opportunity you've given me  Never before in my life have I had to learn how to be so independent  The valuable skills in how to defend my work and my job will serve me well in the future 
Please let Greg know  personally  that I appreciate how much oversight he gave  Some call that micromanaging  I just call it being well informed  How could he do his job well if I wasn't required to ask permission to go to the bathroom  As he always said  "If you're not at your desk  you're not working " Amazing that  in this day and age  anyone would think you could get work done anywhere but at your desk  You should certainly commend Martin for this  as he doesn't leave his desk all day  As his cubicle partner  the special "sun tea" he has in that large jar was a pleasant addition 
I appreciate  too  how hard you all worked to make me feel comfortable  The random drug tests were a welcome event; especially since they were taken every week  I appreciate  too  the thoroughness of them  My chemo medication showed up in every test  and the extra day off to present my case to the Board so I could keep my job served almost like a three day weekend 
I also want to thank Pam in accounting  Without her diligence  I may have gotten a paycheck on time  However  the juggle between which bills I had to pay on what date only added spice to life  Coupled with the medical bills  this was certainly a fun game of When Will I Get Paid 
I know times have been tough around here  I watched most of my friends get fired or laid off for almost no reason  I read all your memos though; the Recession ended in 2009  yet it was the number 1 reason for lay offs and termination last year  Crazy to think how slow the economic growth is huh  In an unrelated note  my son is taking flight lessons and bumped into Mr  Fitzgerald purchasing his third    sorry  fourth    private jet  Be safe in those skies!
Not to take up too much of your time  I understand you're all busy  Mr  Emerson's bottle of scotch isn't going to drink itself! I hate to ruin a good surprise  but just a friendly heads up  there will be a representative from the IRS appearing soon  I won't tell you when  it'll be my gift to you  Remember the monthly birthday parties  where sometimes we would get cake  Well it'll be like that  Except you're definitely getting a visit 
Thanks for the 10 wasted years here  I hope I never see any of you again as long as I live; which may not be long  since you cancelled all our benefits packages  and I haven't been able to afford treatment 
Bottom of Form

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure  It is our light  not our darkness that most frightens us  We ask ourselves   Who am I to be brilliant  gorgeous  talented  fabulous   Actually  who are you not to be  You are a child of God  Your playing small does not serve the world  There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won t feel insecure around you  We are all meant to shine  as children do  We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us  It s not just in some of us  it s in everyone  And as we let our own light shine  we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same  As we are liberated from our own fear  our presence automatically liberates others  
The fear of the dark is a common fear or phobia among children and  to a varying degree  of adults  Fear of the dark is usually not fear of darkness itself  but fear of possible or imagined dangers concealed by darkness  Some degree of fear of the dark is natural  especially as a phase of child development  Most observers report that fear of the dark seldom appears before the age of two years  

Don t be afraid of being scared  To be afraid is a sign of common sense  Only complete idiots are not afraid of anything 
know that this might not be the most eventful ghost story ever recounted but it is a true one  This happened to me personally  I still do not know what exactly happened that night and if you have any information that might help me figure out what happened  feel free to comment 
Last year was my first year attending the University of Texas at San Antonio  Since it was my first year I decided to live on campus  I ended up being assigned to the oldest of the dorm complexes  My boyfriend was living at the newest dorm complex and after only living there a couple of months I found that I rather liked my boyfriend s apartment style dorm and I started living there with him full-time 
One night when he was exceptionally tired and requested that he have the bed all to himself to stretch and relax I decided that it would be a good night to go to my room and have a girl s night in with my roommate whom I hadn t seen in a couple of weeks  It was really chilly out as I walked across the silent parking lot and passed the completely darkened common eatery  I made it to my building and walked up to the third floor alright and then I swung the door open to my dorm only to find it completely dark and empty  It turns out that my roommate decided to go to her home town for the weekend 
I had never had any problems sleeping alone there before  However  that night I found the room immediately to be eerie  I had the feeling that every time I had my back against one part of the room  there was something waiting there  My boyfriend requires that I call him when I arrive at my destination after I ve been walking alone so I did just that 
I called him and told him I wanted to go back to his room or have him over in mine  He refused both saying that it was too late to have me walking around in the dark and that he didn t want to inconvenience himself just because I was a little frightened  I found that acceptable and thought I was being silly so I just chatted with him a while and then he went to bed  I stayed up until about midnight or   AM watching TV 
When I began to get sleepy I got up and turned off all the lights because I cannot fall asleep with the lights on  I fell asleep quickly and I was sleeping fine until something really strange happened  At around   or   a m  I was awoken by the feeling that there was something in the room with me  I was not jilted wide-awake as is the case in most ghost stories  I just sort of opened my eyes and lay there with really blurry vision for a few moments  My mind was really hazy because I was still sleepy  Then a feeling of terror came over me  I could make out an amorphous black misty shade creep up over me as I lay in bed  It had to have been really pure black because the room was completely dark and I still saw this misty entity 
I was horrified and drowsy all at the same time  If that s not enough  I was paralyzed  I wanted to talk or to scream but nothing would come out  I wanted to move my arms in front of my face but I couldn t even move my arms not even an inch  I stayed there for a moment trying to will myself to move but it just wasn t happening  Within a few seconds the shade disappeared and I could move albeit very shakily and with much effort  I decided that even though I was shaken that it was probably just my imagination so I reached up slowly and turned on the light  I left it at that  I awoke several hours later and told my boyfriend about it  He said I was just dreaming  I told my dad about it some weeks later and he too said I had been dreaming 
I know I was not dreaming  When I awoke the morning after my encounter the light was still on just as I had left it after I had been terrorized that night  I recalled everything that happened and I just know that I hadn t been dreaming  Here I am  just about an entire year later and I am still clueless as to what happened 
I did a little bit of research and I have found no evidence or records that anyone has ever died in that building although I guess it wouldn t be publicized  Some weeks before my roommate had told me that she had seen an apparition in the room while she was sleeping alone  She said that she had seen a woman hanging from a noose in the room but I didn t believe her  I still don t believe her because she always made a lot of stories up  and because whatever I felt  I don t think it was even human 
a continuing story as it is still going on  I moved into this current apartment in February       Upon moving in  I had a creepy feeling as if I was being watched  I also was   months pregnant at the time  Besides the creepy feeling everything seemed normal  every now and then I would get a feeling of dread and was frightened 
In September or October of       one night as I was half asleep  I awoke with my body shaking  and I couldn t move  all I could do was scream and pray to God and it eventually went away  I recall having feelings of terror as if an intruder was in my apartment  In December       I had been reading my Bible and praying  laid down to go to bed and turned out the light  I felt a dark or black blanket or covering  cover my entire body from head to toe  Again  it was happening  I couldn t move and I felt helpless  I just cried out to God  rebuking whatever it was in the name of Jesus  It went away 
I began praying and I got goosebumps followed by cold chills  Drafts of cold air were on my cheeks and neck  Later that night at around my baby was screaming bloody murder  Concerned for him I brought him in my bed with me  I watched him and he just stared at the ceiling with a blank stare as his body began to tremble  I again prayed and it went away  I am currently seeking a house blessing from my church  waiting for a call back  Just curious if anyone has experienced something like this 
The scariest thing that happened was when we were watching an NBA game and we heard a loud crash coming from his room on his side of the apartment  We both were too terrified to go back there but I took my phone out and quickly took pictures to try to catch something on film    Nothing showed up  We both finally manned up and went to his room  Everything  and I mean everything had been lifted up off the ground flipped/turned around and dropped  His bed was all over the floor and his golf clubs were everywhere  We had no idea what to do but we stuck it out for the last month and then moved the heck out 

When I wake up I m afraid  somebody else might take my place
Paid that money  fake that dummy  ache my tummy
On the fence  all the time
Paid junk honey  face so sunny  aint that funny
All my friends always lie to me
I know they re thinking
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but I wont fight you
You make me wanna die right when I

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure  It is our light  not our darkness  that most frightens us  Your playing small does not serve the world  There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you  


As she reached the drivers door of the cab which hung open with vines twisting in and out of its socket of a window lightening flashed again painting the whole world purple In its glare Trisha saw something with slumped shoulders standing on the far side of the road something with black eyes and great cocked ears like horns Perhaps they were horns It wasnt human; nor did she think it was animal It was a god It was her god the wasp-god standing there in the rain

Its watchin us Ralphie whispered
Listen Im not gonna-
No Danny Really Cant you feel it
Danny stopped And in the way of children he did feel something and knew they were no longer alone A great hush had fallen over the woods; but it was a malefic hush Shadows urged by the wind twisted languorously around them

His breath stopped in a gasp An almost drowsy terror stole through his veins Yes Yes There was something in here with him some awful thing the Overlook had saved for just such a chance as this Maybe a huge spider that had burrowed down under the dead leaves or a rat… or maybe the corpse of some little kid that had died here on the playground Had that ever happened
At the far end of the concrete ring Danny heard the stealthy crackle of dead leaves as something came for him on its hands and knees

They got into his car and he started it up When he popped on the headlights Chris began to scream hands in fists up to her cheeks Billy felt it at the same time: something in his mind
carrie carrie carrie carrie carrie
a presence
Carrie was standing in front of them perhaps seventy feet away
The high beams picked her out in ghastly horror-movie blacks and whites dripping and clotted with blood Now much of it was her own The hilt of the butcher knife still protruded from her shoulder…
She stood swaying her arms thrown out like the arms of a stage hypnotist and she began to totter towards them

There was a sudden ghastly burping noise in the spectral silence of the Blue Ribbon Laundry – a bat fluttered madly for its hole in the insulation above the dryers where it had roosted wrapping wings around its blind face
It was a noise almost like a chuckle
The mangler began to run with a sudden lurching grind – belts hurrying through the darkness cogs meeting and meshing and grinding heavy pulverising rollers rotating on and on
It was ready for them

Burt jumped from the pulpit and ran down the centre aisle He threw open the outer vestibule door letting in hot sunshine dazzling Vicky was bolt upright behind the steering wheel both hands plastered on the horn ring her head swivelling wildly From all around the children were coming Some of them were laughing gaily They held knives hatchets pipes rocks hammers One girl maybe eight with beautiful long blonde hair held a jackhandle Rural weapons Not a gun among them

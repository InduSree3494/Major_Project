Peacefulness is an inner sense of calm   it comes from becoming still   in
order to reflect and meditate on our inner wisdom and receive answers  A
peaceful heart is one that is free from worry and trouble  It s becoming quiet
so we can look at things quietly so we can more clearly understand them and
thus come up with creative solutions  It is learning to live in the present  
Be anxious for nothing  but in everything by prayer and supplication  with thanksgiving  let your requests be made known to God  and the peace of God  which surpasses all understanding  will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus  
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking  but of righteousness  peace and joy in the Holy Spirit  18 because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval  19 Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification 

 Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing 
and rightdoing there is a field 
I ll meet you there 

When the soul lies down in that grass
the world is too full to talk about 

When I say it s you I like  I m talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch  That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive  Love that conquers hate  peace that rises triumphant over war  and justice that proves more powerful than greed   

When Great Trees Fall

When great trees fall 
rocks on distant hills shudder 
lions hunker down
in tall grasses 
and even elephants
lumber after safety 

When great trees fall
in forests 
small things recoil into silence 
their senses
eroded beyond fear 

When great souls die 
the air around us becomes
light  rare  sterile 
We breathe  briefly 
Our eyes  briefly 
see with
a hurtful clarity 
Our memory  suddenly sharpened 
examines 
gnaws on kind words
unsaid 
promised walks
never taken 

Great souls die and
our reality  bound to
them  takes leave of us 
Our souls 
dependent upon their
nurture 
now shrink  wizened 
Our minds  formed
and informed by their
radiance 
fall away 
We are not so much maddened
as reduced to the unutterable ignorance
of dark  cold
caves 

And when great souls die 
after a period peace blooms 
slowly and always
irregularly  Spaces fill
with a kind of
soothing electric vibration 
Our senses  restored  never
to be the same  whisper to us 
They existed  They existed 
We can be  and 
better  For they existed   

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o er vales and hills 
When all at once I saw a crowd 
A host  of golden daffodils 
Beside the lake  beneath the trees 
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze 

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way 
They stretched in never ending line
Along the margin of a bay  
Ten thousand saw I at a glance 
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance 

The waves beside them danced  but they
Out did the sparkling waves in glee 
A poet could not but be gay 
In such a jocund company 
I gazed  and gazed  but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought 

For oft  when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood  
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude 
And then my heart with pleasure fills 
And dances with the daffodils   


 But the Mahommedan religion increases  instead of lessening  the fury of intolerance  It was originally propagated by the sword  and ever since  its votaries have been subject  above the people of all other creeds  to this form of madness  In a moment the fruits of patient toil  the prospects of material prosperity  the fear of death itself  are flung aside  The more emotional Pathans are powerless to resist  All rational considerations are forgotten  Seizing their weapons  they become Ghazis as dangerous and as sensible as mad dogs  fit only to be treated as such  While the more generous spirits among the tribesmen become convulsed in an ecstasy of religious bloodthirstiness  poorer and more material souls derive additional impulses from the influence of others  the hopes of plunder and the joy of fighting  Thus whole nations are roused to arms  Thus the Turks repel their enemies  the Arabs of the Soudan break the British squares  and the rising on the Indian frontier spreads far and wide  In each case civilisation is confronted with militant Mahommedanism  The forces of progress clash with those of reaction  The religion of blood and war is face to face with that of peace   


When despair for the world grows in me
and I wake in the night at the least sound
in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be 
I go and lie down where the wood drake
rests in his beauty on the water  and the great heron feeds 
I come into the peace of wild things
who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief  I come into the presence of still water 
And I feel above me the day blind stars
waiting with their light  For a time
I rest in the grace of the world  and am free   

Our bodies have five senses  touch  smell  taste  sight  hearing  But not to be overlooked are the senses of our souls  intuition  peace  foresight  trust  empathy  The differences between people lie in their use of these senses  most people don t know anything about the inner senses while a few people rely on them just as they rely on their physical senses  and in fact probably even more   
 If you don t want a man unhappy politically  don t give him two sides to a question to worry him  give him one  Better yet  give him none  Let him forget there is such a thing as war  If the government is inefficient  top heavy  and tax mad  better it be all those than that people worry over it  Peace  Montag  Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year  Cram them full of noncombustible data  chock them so damned full of  facts  they feel stuffed  but absolutely  brilliant  with information  Then they ll feel they re thinking  they ll get a sense of motion without moving  And they ll be happy  because facts of that sort don t change   

 Every person needs to take one day away   A day in which one consciously separates the past from the future   Jobs  family  employers  and friends can exist one day without any one of us  and if our egos permit us to confess  they could exist eternally in our absence   Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted  no solutions searched for   Each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us   

The Simple Path
Silence is Prayer
Prayer is Faith
Faith is Love
Love is Service
The Fruit of Service is Peace

For Equilibrium  a Blessing 
Like the joy of the sea coming home to shore 
May the relief of laughter rinse through your soul 
As the wind loves to call things to dance 
May your gravity by lightened by grace 
Like the dignity of moonlight restoring the earth 
May your thoughts incline with reverence and respect 
As water takes whatever shape it is in 
So free may you be about who you become 
As silence smiles on the other side of what s said 
May your sense of irony bring perspective 
As time remains free of all that it frames 
May your mind stay clear of all it names 
May your prayer of listening deepen enough
to hear in the depths the laughter of god 

The mind can go in a thousand directions  but on this beautiful path  I walk in peace  With each step  the wind blows  With each step  a flower blooms 

That was when it was all made painfully clear to me  When you are a child  there is joy  There is laughter  And most of all  there is trust  Trust in your fellows  When you are an adult   then comes suspicion  hatred  and fear  If children ran the world  it would be a place of eternal bliss and cheer  Adults run the world  and there is war  and enmity  and destruction unending  Adults who take charge of things muck them up  and then produce a new generation of children and say   The children are the hope of the future   And they are right  Children are the hope of the future  But adults are the damnation of the present  and children become adults as surely as adults become worm food  
Adults are the death of hope   

Happiness  true happiness  is an inner quality  It is a state of mind  If your mind is at peace  you are happy  If your mind is at peace  but you have nothing else  you can be happy  If you have everything the world can give   pleasure  possessions  power   but lack peace of mind  you can never be happy 

To enjoy good health  to bring true happiness to one s family  to bring peace to all  one must first discipline and control one s own mind  If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment  and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him  

Happiness  true happiness  is an inner quality  It is a state of mind  If your mind is at peace  you are happy  If your mind is at peace  but you have nothing else  you can be happy  If you have everything the world can give   pleasure  possessions  power   but lack peace of mind  you can never be happy 

The most important thing is to enjoy your life   to be happy   it s all that matters 
I believe in pink  I believe that laughing is the best calorie burner  I believe in kissing  kissing a lot  I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong  I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls  I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles 

A birthday is just another day where you go to work and people give you love  Age is just a state of mind  and you are as old as you think you are  You have to count your blessings and be happy  

 We begin from the recognition that all beings cherish happiness and do not want suffering  It then becomes both morally wrong and pragmatically unwise to pursue only one’s own happiness oblivious to the feelings and aspirations of all others who surround us as members of the same human family  The wiser course is to think of others when pursuing our own happiness  

 The pleasure which we most rarely experience gives us greatest delight  

 Happiness is not in the mere possession of money  it lies in the joy of achievement  in the thrill of creative effort  
 Happiness is not in the mere possession of money  it lies in the joy of achievement  in the thrill of creative effort  

The only thing that will make you happy is being happy with who you are  and not who people think you are 


When I was a child  I lived in an old Victorian house  and I would always hear laughing while I was trying to sleep   I was an only child with a single mother  and when I was about 5 6  I would wake up hearing laughter in the hallway in the middle of the night   After mentioning this to my mum  she swore it was probably just the TV being left on late  
One night  I awoke hearing the laughter in my room   I went to sit up but felt like there was someone holding my shoulders down  invisible hands gripping into my shoulders while I heard laughing   I screamed my little heart out   My mum ran into my room  flicking on the bedside lamp  convincing me it was just a dream  until I said  but my shoulders hurt    She lifted up my t shirt and there were two adult sized hand prints on my shoulders  
I honestly thought I had imagined it and that it had never happened  but the other day I mentioned it in passing to my mum and she went blanket white and said  I don t want to remember that

He starts searching around some bushes when he hears his friends voice coming from a dark corner maybe 20 feet away   They voice calls for him to come over   He didn t  because he was already spooked out enough being outside in the pitch black   My friend yelled back   no! You come over here! 
That s when he said it really started to get spooky   He told me the voice that sounded just like his friend kept insisting that he come over to the dark corner   My friend kept saying no over and over again   At this point  he said the the voice suddenly changed to a dark  horrible sounding voice demanding he come over   At this point he ran back inside  only to see his friend in the living room   When questioned how he got inside so fast  the friend said he never went outside  
Now  I know both of these 2 guys   None of them make up shit   And I doubt it s the case of an  imagination gone wild   
Whatever that voice was  it still spooks me just thinking about this story  

Might sound weird but I had been to this area many times and it was quite safe   Anyway I brought my camera and took lots of pictures   When I came back and developed my film  there were 3 extra pictures that I didn t take of me sleeping   One each night  
None of my stuff was missing or stolen and nothing happened  but it freaked the hell out of me  

She tried to get up to open the front door to see if some kids were playing around with her  but she couldn t   She was frozen in her place on the chair   She said she felt icy cold for about 2 minutes   The fire was blaring   Nan described that after the cold began to fade  she felt very calm and serene  and heard the front gate go once more  
In the morning  when grandad returned home  she explained to him what happened and at what time   He told her he had some terrible news   That her friends ex husband had commited suicide at about 8  50pm that evening   It took about ten minutes walk to my nan s house then from his  

I was so freaked out I just kept looking back at her   I was too to do anything   She slowly faded away   I swear this really happened but I m not sure if it was a ghost or if I was some how semi awake and dreamt it   Scariest thing I have ever experienced though  regardless if it was my imagination or really a ghost  
I didn t tell my friends for a couple months because I couldn t really believe it so I thought they definitely wouldn t   Then a few months after I saw the girl they were telling me how one night they were in their room and they heard children laughing in the living room   They went to their bedroom door to listen better and when they got to the door there was a loud thunk on it like someone hit it   They ran out of the room thinking someone was in their house but when they checked the house there was no one there and all the doors were still locked  
Although the words afraid  and frightened have similar meanings  the grammar is not the same   These are all adjectives and express nearly the same degree of fear   In many cases  they are interchangeable   Frightened is mainly used to talk about a sudden fear

 I thought that if I owned nothing  had nothing  was nothing  I would have nothing left to lose  and I wouldn t be anymore   Because my whole life I ve been so damn   to live because I was to die   But at the same I was so of living  so I wanted to die   Or maybe so of dying that I refused to live   You don t have to be afraid to fall  when you re already on the ground   You don t have to be to lose someone  when there s no one around to lose

Keesha looked at me for a long time    I did leave you alone   We all did   But you didn t get better   You didn t stop   You re still doin  all your weird shit   And I think it s time to stop

 September 11 I will never forget feeling and vulnerable I will never forget feeling the deep sad loss of so many lives I will never forget the smell of the smoke that reached across the water and delivered a deep feeling of doom into my gut I will never forget feeling the boosted sense of unity and pride I will never forget seeing the courageous actions of so many men and women I will never forget seeing people of all backgrounds working together in community I will never forget seeing what hate can destroy I will never forget seeing what love can heal

  It was the kind of terrified look that reminds you that no matter how rational or grown up a person might seem  some part of him is absolutely sure   knows   that an evil other world exists just outside of our regular  everyday world   And that although we don t expect that world to collide with our calm  predictable one   well  really  at any moment that is exactly what might happen

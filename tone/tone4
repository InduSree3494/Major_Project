Most people can motivate themselves to do things simply by knowing that those things need to be done  But not me  For me  motivation is this horrible  scary game where I try to make myself do something while I actively avoid doing it  If I win  I have to do something I don t want to do  And if I lose  I m one step closer to ruining my entire life  And I never know whether I m going to win or lose until the last second   

When you concentrate your energy purposely on the future possibility that you aspire to realize  your energy is passed on to it and makes it attracted to you with a force stronger than the one you directed towards it  
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do  so throw off the bowlines  sail away from safe harbor  catch the trade winds in your sails   Explore  Dream  Discover 

A person today who seems to have a great sense of self esteem has his or her childhood days to thank for it
I alone cannot change the world  but I can cast a stone across the water to create many ripples  
No matter how small you start  always dream big
When you are drowned by your sorry state  and you feel as if you are carried away from the road that leads to your desires  you should know that you are the one responsible for being led away from the right path

Don’t rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth  Only you can be responsible for that  If you can’t love and respect yourself – no one else will be able to make that happen  Accept who you are – completely; the good and the bad – and make changes as YOU see fit – not because you think someone else wants you to be different  

Don’t underestimate the value of Doing Nothing  of just going along  listening to all the things you can’t hear  and not bothering  

There are more things to alarm us than to harm us  and we suffer more often in apprehension than reality  
Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon
What you do not want done to yourself  do not do to others 
Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain  but all the happiness and growth occurs while you’re climbing it 

The deeper that sorrow carves into your being  the more joy you can contain  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven? And is not the lute that soothes your spirit  the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous  look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy  When you are sorrowful look again in your heart  and you shall see in truth that you are weeping for that which has been your delight  

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do  So throw off the bowlines  Sail away from the safe harbor  Catch the trade winds in your sails  Explore  Dream  Discover 
Follow your bliss and don’t be afraid  and doors will open where you didn’t know they were going to be  

I believe compassion to be one of the few things we can practice that will bring immediate and long term happiness to our lives 
A well developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life 
Learn to let go  That is the key to happiness 
And remember  no matter where you go  there you are 
1  Plenty of people miss their share of happiness  not because they never found it  but because they didn’t stop to enjoy it  
Gratitude is a vaccine  an antitoxin  and an antiseptic  
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent 
It was only a sunny smile  and little it cost in the giving  but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living
Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself  in your way of thinking 
Since you get more joy out of giving joy to others  you should put a good deal of thought into the happiness that you are able to give
The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat  known suffering  known struggle  known loss  and have found their way out of the depths  These persons have an appreciation  a sensitivity and an understanding of life that fills them with compassions  gentleness  and a deep loving concern  Beautiful people do not just happen  

We begin from the recognition that all beings cherish happiness and do not want suffering  It then becomes both morally wrong and pragmatically unwise to pursue only one’s own happiness oblivious to the feelings and aspirations of all others who surround us as members of the same human family  The wiser course is to think of others when pursuing our own happiness 
When one door of happiness closes  another opens  but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us 
There is only one cause of unhappiness: the false beliefs you have in your head  beliefs so widespread  so commonly held  that it never occurs to you to question them  

Happiness is not something ready made  It comes from your own actions 
2  It’s a helluva start  being able to recognize what makes you happy  

3  There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will  

4  We tend to forget that happiness doesn’t come as a result of getting something we don’t have  but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have 
5  Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile  but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy 
6  If you want happiness for an hour — take a nap ’
If you want happiness for a day — go fishing 
If you want happiness for a year — inherit a fortune 
If you want happiness for a lifetime — help someone else 
7  Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle  and the life of the candle will not be shortened  Happiness never decreases by being shared  

Happiness is the art of never holding in your mind the memory of any unpleasant thing that has passed 
happiness is letting go of what you think your life is supposed to look like and celebrate it for everything that it is 
with the help of the written word we can look far  far back into time  through the decades  the centuries and  yes  even the millennias 
Today I would like to look back into the past and see what the wise people who have walked on this earth can tell us about happiness and how to uncover it  No matter if you live today or lived two thousand years ago 
This is   ne  of the most inspiring  touching and helpful thoughts from the past on happiness
